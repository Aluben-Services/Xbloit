<p>shackle is a linux build that is very similar to sh1mmer in that it allows easy access to a `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM`
  command prompt without much user input. it's based off tinycore linux, and thus is super small, at around 19-20mb. one
  drawback is that i don't think this works on bitlocker-enabled pcs, though i've yet to test one. it's only been tested
  on windows 7 and windows 10 so far, but should work on others. let me know how it works out!</p>

<p>shackle works by mounting the windows partition (which is selected by the user), and then it replaces one of these 3
  executables that are easily accessible from the login screen:
  - `sethc.exe` (sticky keys, press shift 5 times)
  - `utilman.exe` (ease of access, press the ease of access button)
  - `osk.exe` (on screen keyboard, press the ease of access button, then on screen keyboard)

  by opening one of these from the login screen, a command prompt window will pop up with `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM`
  privileges
  (which is above administrator). this allows you to do anything you want, including changing the administrator account
  password, or changing your account's password.
  once you've got a `SYSTEM` command prompt open:
  - to enable the admin account: `net user administrator /active:yes`
  - to change its password: `net user administrator whateverpasswordyouwant`
  - to give your account admin privileges: `net localgroup Administrators networkcodehere\yourusernamehere /add`</p>
